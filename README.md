# vr-walking-sensor
Arduino based walking sensors for use with VR games

Components:
- ESP32 board
- ESP8266 board
- 28BYJ-48 stepper motor with Uln2003 driver board
- KY-008 laser transmitter

**You could use the same ESP boards (modifying the code slightly). I just used what I had**

Software:
- Python3 - to process solid python code
- OpenScad - for rendering the 3d models
